## Overview

The meeting focused on defining the **core goals, functionality, and requirements** for the project.  
The client emphasized the **Health Equipment Loan Program**, which provides **basic health equipment free of charge to post-operative patients**.  

All operations across the 7 regional offices are **volunteer-run**, with staff members primarily responsible for **scheduling shifts**.

## Project Objective

The goal is to develop a **web-based platform** that helps staff **organize and manage volunteer schedules** efficiently.  
The system should enable both **patients** and **staff** to input their respective availability and requirements to facilitate **automated scheduling**.

### Key Functions:
- Allow **patients** to enter their schedules into the system.  
- Allow **staff** to post available shifts.  
- The system should **match** volunteers with available shifts automatically.  
- Prevent **multiple volunteers** from accepting the same shift.  
- Provide **opt-out functionality** — if a volunteer declines a shift, it should notify coordinators.  
- Include an **SMS notification feature**:  
  - When a shift becomes vacant, a text message is sent to all available volunteers.  
  - Volunteers can then choose whether or not to accept the shift.
