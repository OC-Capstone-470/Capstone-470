## 1. Executive Summary

This project aims to develop a **Volunteer Management Application** that streamlines **recruitment, scheduling, communication, reporting, and recognition**.  
The system reduces administrative overhead while improving volunteer engagement and retention.

The platform supports **three levels of access**:  
- **Admins** (Head Office / Managers)  
- **Coordinators** (Regional Leads / Supervisors)  
- **Volunteers** (Individual Members)

Each role includes tailored permissions and responsibilities.  
The application will be **mobile-first**, **secure**, and **integrated** with external systems such as calendars (Google/Outlook/Apple), messaging channels (SMS, email, push), and reporting tools.

## 4. Example Workflow

1. Volunteer sets weekly availability in their profile.  
2. Coordinator posts a new shift (time, role, location).  
3. System matches volunteers based on availability and sends targeted notifications.  
4. Volunteer accepts the shift in one click (or joins waitlist if full).  
5. System schedules automated reminders (48h and 2h before shift).  
6. Volunteer confirms attendance through reminders.  
7. Coordinator records attendance and adds performance notes.  
8. Volunteer views shared feedback and recognition in the app.  
9. Admin generates reports on volunteer activity (regional or global).
